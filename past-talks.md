## WebCamp Zagreb _Oct 2016_
- Bots, AI APIs, and messy interactions 
  - Difficult presentation to give. The audience was from multiple roles and experience levels so talked generally about the chatbot and AI landscape without deep diving into machine learning. Enjoyed the conference for sure.

## API Days Paris _Dec 2015_ 
- Panel: The future of AI APIs

## API Strat _Nov 2015_
- Machine learning APIs, IBM Watson, and Skynet 
  - Keynote with Elliot Turner of AlchemyAPI. This was a super fun talk. More than anything enjoyed learning about AlchemyAPI and getting to talk about Watson in a really fun point for the product.

## Ad:Tech NYC _Nov 2014_
- Session: Panel on Women in Tech
  - Ahh yes, the session I had *way* too much coffee beforehand. Small audience and a small panel talking about one of my least favorite subjects to discuss. Overall met some great people and got better at speaking in front of crowd.

## Puppet Conf _Sept 2014_ 
- Session: What Developers and Operations can learn from Design
